                Video Overview:<br>Kenyan Red Tea and Okinawan Brown Sugar met aboard the Wahaha's merchant ship. They were sprites from the mountains and the sea, who embarked on Wahaha's whimsical voyage through 'The Realm of Culinary Delights'. Under the witness of a playful Milk sprite, a savory tale of mountain and sea unfolded. This indicated the birth of Wahaha's unique Brown Sugar Milk Tea flavor.

                    <p class="scene1-content">I explored the unique blend of tradition and innovation in my animation showcasing Wahaha's Black Sugar Milk Tea. It presents a fantasy world where the rich taste of Okinawan black sugar and the robust flavor of Kenyan highland tea come together, creating a stylish yet soothing beverage. The animation highlights the sophisticated simplicity of enjoying a well-crafted drink through mythological colors and unique ukiyo-e style.</p>
